    	large C++ multi-threaded open-source database.

    Intern
    Microsoft India
    May 2012 to July 2012

    	I worked on developing a tool for efficient grouping and encoding
    	of columns of an excel sheet and store them in database. Extended
    	this tool to find difference with existing rows in database and 
    	generate sql script for difference. Language: C#

Projects

	Plug-in For Volcano Optimizer
	Course Project
	March 2012 to April 2012 

		Implemented a plan refinement algorithm for a database query  by 
		avoiding unnecessary sorting and grouping which is inferred based
		on order properties. Language: C++

	Modules of a small Database( Mubase )
	Course Project
	October 2011 to November 2011

		Worked on a team of four to implement certain modules of Mubase. I
		implemented relationManager class, storage and retrieval of fixed
		and variable length data and two operator classes, sorting and 
		projection. Language: C++

	Database queries using files
	Course Project
	August 2011 to September 2011

		Implemented simple database queries like select, project, cross 
		product, intersection and  union with simple predicates. Relations
		were stored in text files.Parsed a  small subset of SQL language
		and built an operator tree using Yacc. Language: C++
	
	Performance study and enhancement of MPTCP
	Mini Project
	September 2012 to November 2012 

		Involved enabling systems with multiple network interfaces to create
		multiple TCP connections to the same server via different interfaces
		Identified bottlenecks in MPTCP by doing simulation in ns3.
